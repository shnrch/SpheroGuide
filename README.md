# ButtonDrive

You can see from the diagram how Sphero's roll commands correspond to its heading in space.

This code sample demonstrates driving a Sphero by sending roll commands at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. The roll command 
takes a heading from 0° to 360°, and a relative speed from 0.0 to 1.0. So, to command the ball to go 90° at half speed would be:

    RollCommand.sendCommand(mRobot, 90.0, 0.5);

The ball is stopped with the `RKRollCommand.sendStop()`.
